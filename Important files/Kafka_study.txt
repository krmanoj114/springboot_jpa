Apache Kafka
============
Apache Kafka - Apache Kafka is highly scalable and distributed platform for creating and processing stream in real time.
It is used for:- 
			Creating real time data stream
			Processing real time data stream
			
How kafka works:-
Kafka works as a pub-sub messaging system, where we create producer applications to send data as stream we install and configure kafka server as a message broker and finally we create the consumer applications to process data in realtime.

Kafka was initial introduced with
		1>Server software -Brocker -- centeral server system
		2>Client API- Java Library
				a)Producer API  -- Producer
				b)Consumer API   -- Consumer
Later they introduced as full flex streaming platform and they augmented:-
		1>Kafka Connect   -- addrees the data integration
		2>Kafka Stream    -- creating realt time stream
		3>KSQL 

Core Concept:--
1>Producer - produce the messages
2>Consumer - consume the message
3>Broker  -  Centeral server system
4>Cluster   - Group of centeral server system
5>Topic    - Topic is an arbitrary name given to data set or unique name for data stream, creating a topic is design time desison. publisher and
             consumer send and received data by topic, all communication happen throgh brocker  
6>Partitions  - A small and independent portion of topic is called topic partition. partition in a topic in design desison, while creating the topic need to specify the number of partition. partition is a smallest unit and its going to sit on a single mechine. one can not break again.
7>Partition Offset -is a unique sequence id of a message in the partition. sequence id is automatically assigned by brockeer on arrival, offset id are local
8>Consumer Groups - is a group of consumer to share the load. 

what is kafka connect - is a system which can be placed in between you data source and kafka sserver. which read data from data base and send it to brocker. these are two type:-
		1> Source Connecter - 
		2> Sink connecter  -  

Kafka Streams :- Kafka streams is a library for building application and microservices, where input data is streamed into kafka topic.

What is KSQL - is an sql interface to kafaka stream.
